# Intended Use of the Software

## Purpose 
The Symptom Solver App is a software application designed to assist individuals in identifying potential illnesses based on their reported symptoms. The app aims to provide preliminary diagnostic insights that can guide users in seeking appropriate medical advice or intervention.

## Intended User
The app is intended for use by the general public, including individuals who are experiencing symptoms and are seeking initial guidance on possible health conditions.

## Intended Use Environment
The app is intended for use in home  environments. Users can access the app on their personal mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, as well as on desktop computers.


# Classification of the Healthcare situation
We classify our App into healthcare situation category 2. The reason is explained below:
All of the diseases listed in the app are non-serious and can be treated at home. The app will not provide any information on serious diseases like cancer, heart attack, stroke, etc. Additionally, the app will not provide any information on mental health conditions. Although there is the case, that our App does not know the disease, in this case, it is very important that the patient seeks further medical advice. The app will advise the user to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 

---> Open Point: Normally we would categorize our App into Cat 3, but the case where the user has a serious disease and the app does not know the disease is not covered by the classification. Does this move the App into Cat 2 or can we generally exlude such cases?


# Classification of the Significance of information provided
The app will not provide any information on diseases that require immediate medical attention.
The App will everytime advise the user to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Additionally the app will display a message like "if you experiece a different symptom, please consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Since the app will be used to aid in diagnosis of low-risk diseases, the class 2 is appropriate for the app.


# Critical Functionality of the Software
The Symptom Solver App is indicated for use in evaluating a broad range of symptoms reported by the user. By inputting specific symptoms, users receive a potential illness that matches the symptom profile. The app covers a wide spectrum of common and uncommon medical conditions.

## Limitations
The app is not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis or treatment. It provides preliminary information and should not be used as the sole basis for making health decisions. Users are advised to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.


# Open Points
What about risks, e.g. a cancer patient using the app with headache and the app not suggesting to consult a healthcare provider?

If the app cannot identify the disease, what should the app do? Especially if the user has a serious disease, the app should not suggest a home treatment.

What about exclusion procedure? It is not realistic, that a user with cancer uses the app. How can we exclude such users?

Does a cancer patient use the app?
