| Communication between frontend and backend (symptoms, disease) | 1. Wrong list of symptoms gets  passed on to the backend 2.

User  experiences light side effects of any medication he took for treating another disease. |
| Displaying list of symptoms and  predicted disease             | a) Doesn't allow system messages  to be displayed if in full-screen mode b) Content is not nicely readable (Font Size is too small / no to minimal contrast)  | a) System messages don't reach the user b) The user can't comfortably read the content          | a) User does not act on any system warning messages (on smartphone  for example by the Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und  Katastrophenhilfe) b) User strains his eyes or  positions his device closer to his face | a) Death of user b) User stumbles and consequently insures himself slightly                                                                                                                             |
