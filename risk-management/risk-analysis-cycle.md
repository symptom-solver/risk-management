In the Definition Statement, chapter "Classification of Healthcare Situation",
it is specifically required for the app to 1. not be used by persons that suffer from serious diseases like cancer, heart attack, stroke, etc., 
even if they want to use it regarding other non-serious diseases,
2. not provide any information on mental health conditions and 
3. advise the user to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Therefore, before starting the risk analysis, we can already define a corresponding risk mitigating measure:
The app will display a screen-sized message on opening to every user, with every use, containing said information.
Therefore we will not evaluate the risk of an user using the app having one of the mentioned conditions.

With the implemented risk mitigating measures don't come any new foreseeable risks.
The analysis can be closed for the actual state of the application as the current risks are all acceptable.
